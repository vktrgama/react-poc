Victor contributed significantly to the release of the Ancestry Health product through his leadership as both the Technical Lead and as the Scrum Master. I relied heavily on his React and Java expertise and appreciated his ability to mentor more junior engineers. Victor has a calm demeanor and steady temperament that helped to calm the team when schedules were tight and stress levels were high. I highly recommend Victor as a very capable software engineer and all-around great guy.”

Despite incredibly tight deadlines and limited resources, Victor was able to step up and lead all 6 members of the team as the interim engineering manager. Victor supported the team through crucial moments of the development process working hard to highlight and represent the success of the team. Victor's leadership and technical background proved to be essential to the success of AncestryHealth.”
